        Greetings! This is my first time writing a blog, so excuse me if I'm doing this wrong. I'm excited to post regularly & share the cool things I learn about at school or on the web. For now, they'll typically be things related to biology or history as I'm taking AP Bio & APUSH. However, I'm starting today's off on a bit more <em>serious</em> note. My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had me & my sisters come over after school. Her dog, Roxanne, needs to be put down tomorrow; she's 18 years old and in a lot of pain. I'm glad I got to see her, I think she's a rat terrier and her tongue sticks out the side of her mouth constantly. She's really skinny. It's crazy to think a dog that small is older than me. I'll miss her a lot.
