        Greetings! This is my first time writing a blog, so excuse me if I'm doing this wrong. I'm excited to post regularly & share the cool things I learn about at school or on the web. For now, they'll typically be things related to biology or history as I'm taking AP Bio & APUSH.

        However, I'm starting today's off on a bit more <em>serious</em> note. My neighbor had me & my sisters come over after school. Her dog, Roxanne, needs to be put down tomorrow; she's 18 years old and in a lot of pain. I'm glad I got to see her, I think she's a rat terrier and her tongue sticks out the side of her mouth constantly. She's also really skinny. It's crazy to think a dog that small is older than me. I'll miss her a lot.

        Anyways, I hope this project will be as fun as it sounds. I've been journaling almost every day in a notebook for the past month & a half, and it really seems to help. Maybe getting to publish my thoughts will help too as I usually don't talk about these things much. The biggest problem I'll face blogging is formatting; it took me half an hour to settle on having 100 posts per page & the folders they're stored in. However, that's out of the way, and I shouldn't need to change it. That's it for now, but I reckon I'll post tomorrow.
