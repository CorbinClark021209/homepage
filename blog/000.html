        Greetings! This is my first time writing a blog, so excuse me if I'm doing this wrong. I'm excited to post regularly & share the cool things I learn about at school or on the web. For now, they'll typically be things related to biology or history as I'm taking AP Bio & APUSH.
      </p>

        However, I'm starting today's off on a bit more <em>serious</em> note. My neighbor had me & my sisters come over after school. Her dog, Roxanne, needs to be put down tomorrow; she's 18 years old and in a lot of pain. I'm glad I got to see her, I think she's a rat terrier and her tongue sticks out the side of her mouth constantly. She's also really skinny. It's crazy to think a dog that small is older than me. I'll miss her a lot.

        Anyways, I hope this project will be as fun as it sounds. I've been journaling almost every day in a notebook for the past month & a half, and it really seems to help. Maybe getting to publish my thoughts will help too as I usually don't talk about these things much. The biggest problem I'll face blogging is formatting; it took me half an hour to settle on having 100 posts per page & the folders they're stored in. However, that's out of the way, and I shouldn't need to change it. That's it for now, but I reckon I'll post tomorrow.
      </p>

        P.S. This is also my first time using GitHub. I'm extremely new and I've probably already messed <em>something</em> up. If you have any suggestions please contact me.

        #0001: Yap #1 - Respiration

        My first real blog will be the first in a series known as "Yaps". I'll basically just explain some topic I learned about recently or that I find interesting. Keep in mind that this information is just off the top of my head, so take it with a grain of salt. Today's will be cellular respiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, respiration has 2 types: aerobic & anaerobic. Aerobic respiration takes place when your cells have plenty of O<sub>2</sub>, and produces around <em>40</em> ATP, which is, in short, a molecule your body uses for energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs when your cels lack oxygen, such as if your circulatory system malfunctions. It produces 4 ATP.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aerobic Respiration</strong><br>
        Chemical formula: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (glucose) + O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) = CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) + H<sub>2</sub>O (water) + ATP (adenosine triphosphate)<br>
        Aerobic respiration has 4 main steps: Glycolysis, a prep reaction, the Krebs Cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In the cytoplasm, glucose is received from the environment & is broken apart by glycolysis into 2 pyruvates. During this process the split carbon chains gain phosphates & then give them to ADP molecules, forming ATP. This happens 4 times in total. During this process, hydrogen atoms are removed from the 'half-glucoses', oxidizing them. The hydrogen latch onto NAD<sup>+</sup> molecules to form NADH. This molecule serves as a 'bus' for hydrogen, more on that later. The pyruvates are moved into the cell's mitochondria for the rest of the processes. Keep in mind that the following happens twice from each glucose molecule, as 2 pyruvates are produced. The mitochindria removes a carbon atom from a pyruvate & converts it into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl coA) in the prep reaction. Acetyl coA enters the Krebs Cycle, which is a circle of reactions that I don't know the inner workings of but produce the following: 3x NADH, 2x CO<sub>2</sub>, 1x FADH<sub>2</sub>, 1x ATP. FADH<sub>2</sub> is another 'bus' molecule. The carbon dioxide leaves the mitochondria and will be exhaled by the organism. For context, mitochondria have 2 membranes, aptly named the inner & outer membrane. Between them is the intermembrane space & the inside fluid is called the matrix. The last 2 processes occurred exclusively in the matrix. Now, the bus molecules, NADH & FADH<sub>2</sub> get to come into play. The mitochondria has Electron Transport Chains (ETCs) in its inner membrane. These are essentially a series of channels. The buses arrive, releasing a proton & electron each. Electrons 'hop onto' one protein in the ETC & move to the end of the chain. As they move, they create a negative charge, attracing protons to move through the channels and into the intermembrane space. In this space there is a large buildup of protons, and they will naturally want to flow into a less concentrated space. The mitochondria also has proteins called ATP synthase in the inner membrane. When a proton flows through them and into the matrix, the protein spins. This motion gives it the energy to take ADP & phosphorylate (add a phosphate) it into ATP. For each glucose molecule, this produces around <em>34</em> ATP. Wow. However, there's one more thing. The electrons at the end of the ETCs need somewhere to go; if they can't move ATP synthases no longer receive protons, bus molecules fill up, making the mitochondria's prep reactions & Krebs Cycle shut down. But, remember that respiration takes oxygen? O<sub>2</sub> molecules can accept electrons from the end of the ETC along with protons released by ATP synthase, forming H<sub>2</sub>O (water). Oxygen is thus dubbed the 'final electron acceptor'.

        However, remember how your mitochondria need oxygen or else your cells are unable to make sufficient ATP? Well, this is when anaerobic respiration kicks in.

        <string>Anaerobic Respiration</string><br>
        I forgot the formula :/<br>
        Anaerobic respiration has 2 parts: Glycolysis & fermentation (yes, you read that correctly). Glycolysis occurs the same as in aerobic respiration. However, the resulting pyrvates and NADH's are unable to be used. Your cells have special enzymes that use these to make lactic acid. Fun fact, yeast cells have a different form of fermentation that instead produces <em>alcohol</em>. This reaction produces a bit more ATP (I think 2), allowing your cells to stay alive a bit longer while they try to get oxygen.
